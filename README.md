# The rest of the drone module for week 8

``` bash 
For this week 8 we continued the modules part for our drone project and successfully finished it . 
The files we created led.py which is helpful for adding service availability check to led module 
then mavros_wrapper.py the reason we created this python
file is that for  adding the  docstrings to mavros wrapper and  decreasing timeouts. The last
to finish the Module part we needed a file to fix handling exceptions that's why we added the tasking.py
```
## For this week we are done with the module part of drone project
